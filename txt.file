Differences between SQL and NoSQL


SQL table = NoSQL collection

SQL row = NoSQL Document

SQL Column = NoSQL field

SQL requires queries to join multiple tables but NoSQL documents can have hundreds++ fields

NoSQL data organized hierarchically 

NoSQL better for large dataset and evolving data structure
